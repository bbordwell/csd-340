                        <p>I have always loved astronomy. As a kid I had a small telescope and a pair of binoculars that I enjoyed using.
                            When I was older I continued to enjoy just looking at the stars, but I did not have the money to pursue it further.
                            Eventually I had enough money that I got back into it and got nice telescope as well as better binoculars.
                            I also combined this interest with my interest in photography and started doing astrophotography.

                        <p>My wife and I love to go camping. We have been camping all over the United States. 
                            We mostly do car camping, but we have done a litte backpacking as well.
                            We only ever camp in a tent, and we have camped in weather between 20 and 110 degrees.

                            I enjoy photography as well. I have done portraits before, my favorite types of photography are astrophotography and nature photography.
                            These two types of photography go well together with my other hobbies of astronomy and camping.

                            I currently work as a warehouse clerk. I am primarily in charge of making sure that trucks get loaded on time.
                            I also make sure that recieved product matches the billed product to ensure inventory is correct.
                            To do this I use warehouse management software, transportation management software, yard management software, and many other software tools.

                            I also worked as a warehouse generalist. The position is called generalist because I had to know how to do everything.
                            I selected product, operated a forklift, received product, loaded trailers, and more.
